# SIADS-Capstone-Volatility-Prediction


## Project Statement

Our project's objective is to predict the volatility of certain stocks. We will also include some exploratory data analysis for the data before model applying and choosing. 

## Methodology

First, we will use time series analytics first before model fitting, like checking stationarity, seasonality,etc.
For model choosing, we will try multiple models and compare their performance. We will compare the classical approachesm for example ARCH/GARCH models, machine learning models for example SVR and deep learning models.
